\coanote{In this chapter, we describe in detail functional
and non-functional requirements of a solution for the problem.}

\section{Functional requirements}
\label{sec:func-req}
Which functions must be offered to users / other programs?
Which are the input data and the output data?
Which is the expected effect?


\section{Non functional requirements}
\label{sec:nonfunc-req}
Everything about mode and transparencies:
availability, mobility, security, fault tolerance, etc.
Are there execution time bounds? Minimum data rates?

If requested, specific platforms/languages/middlewares requirements
for the implementation can be decided here.
(E.g.: if the project is on a SOA, we may request that functions
are offered via SOAP or RESTful services).
