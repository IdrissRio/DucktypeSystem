This chapter is devoted to the description of the general
architectures, and specific algorithms.

\section{Logical architecture}
\label{sec:logical-arch}
Describe the components of your systems:
modules/objects/components/services.
For each component, describe the functionalities it implements,
and by who is used.

\section{Protocols and algorithms}
\label{sec:protocols}
Communication between components.
UML sequence diagrams go here.
Also, put here a detailed description of distributed algorithms
used to solve specific problems of the project.

\section{Physical architecture and deployment}
\label{sec:deploy}
Which nodes and platforms involved, and where each
component is deployed.
